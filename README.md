# Library-Management-System-Version-2

A system that allows to maintain a record of the library. This is an updated system of the version 1 that I had made earlier.

In this system there are 3 levels of access.
    1. Member \n
    2. Librarian
    3. Administrator

Members are allowed to reserve and return books. Once a book is reserved they will have to wait until it's issued by a librarian. During this waiting period, members are allowed 
to cancel their reservation if they choose to. Once a book has been issued, the member can return it once done. Members can view the books that they have reserved, been issued and
the one's they have submitted for return.

Librarians control the flow of books. They issue books that have been reserved by members. They can add a book to the system, remove one and edit the info of books. They can see 
the books been issued to members. A librarian also has access to all the book records.
